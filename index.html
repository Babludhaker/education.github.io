        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
          Transformative learning, as a theory, says that the process of
          "perspective transformation" has three dimensions: psychological
          (changes in understanding of the self), convictional (revision of
          belief systems), and behavioral (changes in lifestyle).[1]
          Transformative learning is the expansion of consciousness through the
          transformation of basic worldview and specific capacities of the self;
          transformative learning is facilitated through consciously directed
          processes such as appreciatively accessing and receiving the symbolic
          contents of the unconscious and critically analyzing underlying
          premises.[2] Perspective transformation, leading to transformative
          learning, occurs infrequently. Jack Mezirow believes that it usually
          results from a "disorienting dilemma" which is triggered by a life
          crisis or major life transitionâ€”although it may also result from an
          accumulation of transformations in meaning schemes over a period of
          time.[3] Less dramatic predicaments, such as those created by a
          teacher for pedagogical effect, also promote transformation.[4] An

Education in India means the process of teaching, learning, and training of human capital in schools and colleges. This improves and increases knowledge and results in skill development hence enhancing the quality of the human capital. Our government has always valued the importance of education in India and this is reflected in our economic policies.

         Indian government considers education as a key area where drastic growth and development is required. So various future prospects have been considered and policies are drafted. The vision is to ensure that education in India is of the highest quality and available to the whole population without discrimination. Let us look at some projects the government wishes to implement successfully.

         
          Though the education level has increased for both youth as well as adults, still the number of illiterates is as much as the population was at the time of independence. The constituent assembly passed the Constitution of India in the year 1950. Free and compulsory education for the children till 14 years of age within 10 years from the commencement of constitution was noted as Directive Principal of the constitution. Following are the factors which make education for all a dream:
          
          G
          Low rural access
          Increasing number of illiterates
          Privatization
          Low expenditure on education by government
          
          ckward states. Social and Economic Poverty are main reasons for educational backwardness.

          Education policy analysis is the scholarly study of education policy. It seeks to answer questions about the purpose of education, the objectives (societal and personal) that it is designed to attain, the methods for attaining them and the tools for measuring their success or failure. Research intended to inform education policy is carried out in a wide variety of institutions and in many academic disciplines.The academic discipline draws from - and influences - theories, frameworks, and analyses developed in the social sciences. Sociology, political science, economics, and law are all disciplines that can be used to better understand how education systems function, what their impacts are, and how policies might be changed for different conditions. Education policy is sometimes considered a sub-field of social policy and public policy, nevertheless it is connected aspects of those policy disciplines.
